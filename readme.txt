I used the framework given by udacity for this project and took some code from the lessons for this one.

As wished I only added the particle_filter.cpp, but in two versions. The first one in the directory 'simulator' is for the new version of the project with the udacity simulator, whereas the second one in the folder 'old' can be used for the earlier framework-version for this project (without the simulator). The reason behind that is, that in booth versions all errors are below the treshold (so I get a pass in the simulator/bash), but it seems that the error in the simulator-version is quite larger than the really low one for the earlier version.

I'm not sure if udacity changed something up for the new version (groundthruth/given data) or if it's a bug in the simulator... Booth of my particle_filter.cpps are nearly identical except for some small adjustments neaded to run for each framework.

The code has comments to explain, what I used and did to implement the particle filter.

I hope everything works as expected.

Thanks for the review and have a nice week. :)

Greetings Frank
